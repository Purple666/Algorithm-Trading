# Algorithm-Trading
Automated FX trading robots

Take a look at the squadron of algorithm-trading robots I've been assembling. 

Some of them are quite effective at making consistent profits, but some are not. 

Each bot uses its own cocktail of technical analysis techniques, some of which rely on one or two methods at a time and some of which rely on many methods combined.

Oh yeah, and they all have cool names LOL.
